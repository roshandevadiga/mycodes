- Moved the code iteratinng over the objects to mysql as it is faster 
- Create 2 scopes in Customer model (moving the responsibility to concerned model)
  - relations  : to give the AREL object
  - valid_ones : filter the  valid customer at db level rather than iterating over than
- Can have a seperate class whose function is to update records passed to them 
- Added comments in the code where changes where made
